/**
 * Runs new coroutine and **blocks** current thread _interruptibly_ until its completion.
 * This function should not be used from coroutine. It is designed to bridge regular blocking code
 * to libraries that are written in suspending style, to be used in `main` functions and in tests.
 *
 * The default [CoroutineDispatcher] for this builder in an implementation of [EventLoop] that processes continuations
 * in this blocked thread until the completion of this coroutine.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the other implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 *
 * When [CoroutineDispatcher] is explicitly specified in the [context], then the new coroutine runs in the context of
 * the specified dispatcher while the current thread is blocked. If the specified dispatcher implements [EventLoop]
 * interface and this `runBlocking` invocation is performed from inside of the this event loop's thread, then
 * this event loop is processed using its [processNextEvent][EventLoop.processNextEvent] method until coroutine completes.
 *
 * If this blocked thread is interrupted (see [Thread.interrupt]), then the coroutine job is cancelled and
 * this `runBlocking` invocation throws [InterruptedException].
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context context of the coroutine. The default value is an implementation of [EventLoop].
 * @param block the coroutine code.
